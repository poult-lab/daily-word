"an area that one person, group, animal, etc. considers as their own and defends against others who try to enter it"

"Region" and "territory" are related words that both refer to a specific geographic area, but they have slightly different connotations.

A "region" is a larger and more general area that is defined by certain characteristics such as geography, climate, culture, or economy. For example, a region might be defined by a common language, shared history, or similar geographic features such as mountains or coastlines. Regions can be political, cultural, or geographical in nature, and they can overlap with other regions.

A "territory," on the other hand, is a more specific area that is defined by political or legal boundaries. It usually refers to a defined area that is governed by a particular government or authority. For example, a territory might be a country, state, province, or any other political division that has a specific set of rules, regulations, and governance structures.

In summary, "region" refers to a larger and more general area that is defined by certain characteristics, while "territory" refers to a specific area that is defined by political or legal boundaries.

51.pronounced /prəˈnaʊnst/

[adj] He walked with a pronounced limp. "very **noticeable**, obvious or strongly expressed" -definite-



"Pronounced" typically describes something that is very noticeable or prominent, often because it is emphasized or exaggerated.

Similarly, a pronounced feature of a building might refer to a particular element that is especially prominent or noticeable.

"Obvious," on the other hand, simply means that something is easily perceived or understood, without necessarily implying that it is particularly prominent or emphasized. For instance, you might say that it's obvious that it's raining outside because you can hear the sound of the raindrops on the **roof**, even if the rain is not particularly heavy or noticeable.

In summary, "pronounced" suggests that something is very noticeable or **prominent**, often because it is emphasized, while "obvious" simply means that something is easily perceived or understood, without necessarily implying that it is particularly prominent or emphasized.

[adv] crucially important.



"Critical" is another word that is often used to describe something that is important, but it has a slightly different meaning compared to "crucial," "vital," and "essential." Here's a breakdown of each word:

- Crucial: Something that is crucial is essential to the success or completion of something else. It suggests that without this particular element, the entire endeavor would be jeopardized. For example, "His experience was crucial to the project's success," suggests that without his experience, the project would have failed.
- Vital: Something that is vital is necessary for the existence, well-being, or continued existence of something else. It suggests that the thing being described is absolutely necessary and cannot be replaced. For example, "Oxygen is vital to human survival," suggests that without oxygen, humans cannot survive.
- Essential: Something that is essential is necessary in order to achieve a certain result or outcome. It suggests that the thing being described is important, but may not necessarily be irreplaceable. For example, "Good communication is essential for a successful team," suggests that good communication is **necessary** for success, but there may be other ways to achieve success besides good communication.
- Critical: Something that is critical is extremely important and often urgent. It suggests that the situation is serious and requires immediate attention. For example, "The patient's condition is critical," suggests that the patient's condition is very serious and requires urgent medical attention.

So, while all four words describe something that is important, crucial implies that the thing being described is indispensable for success, vital suggests that it is necessary for existence, essential implies that it is necessary for achieving a desired outcome, and critical implies that the situation is serious and requires immediate attention.

twisted ankle vs sprained ankle



> 扭一纽脚踝vs扭伤脚踝
>
> **A sprained ankle is similar to a twisted ankle but to a greater degree**. When you sprain your ankle, it means you have stretched, and possibly even torn, the ligaments of your ankle. If your ankle is swollen, bruised and painful after you twist it, then you have most likely sprained it.

> 
>
> I think tweak and yank are somewhat like slang, so I would use caution and not use them in an essay, but in common speech they are fine.   Yank is like pull, but pull can be a **gradual motion**, **yank is usually abrupt**.   Twist implies a turning of one part the object while the rest stays in place, so it gets usually deformed.  It can be done while you pull it, or you can also not pull it, just twist it where it is.  You are usually deforming it by turning.  So we say "twist words", that is to say, change their meaning, like when you partially misquote someone and make it look like they are saying something else.
>
> 
>
> Mind you, in twisting, it does not necessarily get deformed, for example you can try to pull something out of a hole by twisting (turning) and pulling to make it come out. But you can twist a straw and it becomes unusable to drink with, it is all twisted.

> 
>

Politeness generally refers to using manners, etiquette, and formal language in order to show respect or deference to others. For example, saying "please" and "thank you," using appropriate titles and forms of address, and being mindful of others' personal space are all examples of polite behavior.

Courtesy, on the other hand, refers to demonstrating kindness, friendliness, and consideration towards others. <ins>It involves being aware of others' needs and feelings, and making an effort to be helpful and accommodating. For example, holding the door open for someone, offering to help someone with their bags, or smiling and making eye contact when greeting someone are all examples of courteous behavior.</ins>

Tough is used for people or objects. It describes how well something can handle something else.
"my jeans are made of tough material, they won't tear." "He's a tough guy, he can handle working 10 hours in the heat."

> "Dissolve" and "melt" are two different processes that involve the transformation of substances from one state to another, typically involving a change from a solid state to a liquid state. However, they are distinct processes with different implications:
>
> **Melt**:
>
> - **Definition**: Melting is the process of a solid substance changing into a liquid state due to an increase in temperature. When a solid melts, its molecules or atoms gain enough kinetic energy to break free from their fixed positions and move more freely, transitioning into a liquid state.
> - **Example**: Ice melts into water when heated above its melting point (0°C or 32°F at standard atmospheric pressure).
>
> **Dissolve**:
>
> - **Definition**: Dissolving refers to the process in which a solid substance (solute) becomes incorporated into a liquid (solvent) at the molecular or ion level. It typically involves the breaking of chemical bonds in the solid as it mixes with the solvent. Dissolving can also occur with gases in liquids or solids in other solids.
> - **Example**: When you add table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) to water, the salt crystals break apart into sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-) as they become dispersed in the water. This is an example of dissolution.
>
> In summary, melting is a phase change from solid to liquid due to an increase in temperature, while dissolving involves the incorporation of solid (or gas) particles into a liquid at the **molecular** or ion level, often without a change in temperature. They are related processes but have distinct mechanisms and implications.

> "Relatively," "comparatively," and "correspondingly" are all adverbs that are used to establish a relationship or make a comparison between different elements. While they share some similarities, there are slight differences in their meanings and usage:
>
> Relatively: This adverb is used to indicate a comparison between two or more things in relation to each other. It suggests that something is considered or evaluated in relation to something else. It highlights the degree or extent of a quality or characteristic in comparison to others. For example:
> - "The rent in this city is relatively high compared to neighboring towns."
> - "She is relatively young compared to her colleagues." "相对de"
>
> Comparatively: This adverb is used to draw a comparison between two or more things, highlighting similarities or differences. It indicates that something is being considered in relation to a standard or benchmark. It is often used to express a relative degree or extent. For example:
> - "The car is comparatively cheaper than other models in its class."
> - "The company's profits increased comparatively more this year." "相比较de"
>
> Correspondingly: This adverb is used to indicate a relationship or connection between two or more things, suggesting that one thing corresponds or matches with another. It emphasizes that there is a parallel or corresponding aspect in relation to something else. For example:
> - "As the demand for the product increased, the price correspondingly rose."
> - "The company's sales went up, and correspondingly, its market share increased." "相对应de"
>
> In summary, "relatively" emphasizes the comparison in relation to others, "comparatively" emphasizes a comparison to a standard or benchmark, and "correspondingly" highlights a **parallel or matching relationship** between elements.
>
> 
>
> another explanation:
>
> What is the difference between comparatively and relatively?
>
> They are very similar. Comparatively is simply good for when you are making a comparison between two or more things. Like "Japan is comparatively safer than other countries."  Relatively can be used for comparison but also as "basically". For example, you can say "This is relatively easy!". A comparison is implied, but it doesn't feel as direct as "comparatively". I use "relatively" often in conversation. I never use comparatively though. It's more academic.

> The levels of formality are, in descending order: *intentionally*, *deliberately*, and *on purpose*. If you look at published books and journals that have blank pages, you'll find some with printed statements "This page **intentionally** left blank". That's because it's the most formal and the most neutral. Yes, *deliberately* is a synonym that means *intentionally*, but it more often has a negative connotation than *intentionally* does (especially among high school students, at least that was true when I was in high school), although both words are used both positively and negatively, e.g., *That was {a deliberate / an intentional snub}* (negative use, and [Google Ngrams](http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=intentional snub,deliberate snub&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=) shows more frequent use of the former than the latter). Maybe that's merely because *deliberately* is more frequently used than *intentionally* is.
>
> Wikipedia has an article on *[deliberate practice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method))*, however, which shows that word's very positive connotation. There are also Web pages for *[intentional practice](http://www.wisdompage.com/practicing.html)* that show its equally positive connotation. [Google Ngrams](http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=intentional practice,deliberate practice&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=) shows that *deliberate practice* is more often used than *intentional practice*. *On purpose* is what children say for *intentionally* and *deliberately*, which is why it's the at the lowest level of formality of those three terms. They are not always interchangeable: register and context must be taken into account.

> "Deliberately," "intentionally," and "on purpose" are all adverbs that convey the idea of doing something with a specific intention or purpose. While they share a similar meaning, there are subtle differences in usage and emphasis.
>
> Deliberately: This adverb emphasizes the careful consideration or thought that goes into an action. When someone does something deliberately, it implies that they have taken the time to think about the consequences or implications before acting. It suggests a level of premeditation or planning. For example:
>
> "He deliberately chose his words to avoid causing offense."
>
> Intentionally: This adverb focuses on the intent behind an action. When someone does something intentionally, it means they had a clear purpose or objective in mind while carrying out the action. It implies that the action was not accidental or unintentional. For example:
>
> "She intentionally left the party early because she had an early morning appointment."
>
> On purpose: This adverb emphasizes the conscious decision to perform an action for a specific reason. It indicates that the action was not accidental or incidental but was done deliberately for a particular purpose. For example:
>
> "He knocked over the vase on purpose to get attention."
>
> In summary, while "deliberately" emphasizes careful consideration, "intentionally" focuses on the intention, and "on purpose" highlights the conscious decision to carry out an action. They are often used interchangeably, but the choice of one over the other can depend on the context and the nuance you want to convey.

> Conflict and clash are both terms used to describe situations involving disagreement or opposition, but they carry slightly different connotations and nuances. Here's an explanation of their differences:
>
> Conflict: Conflict refers to a broader concept of disagreement or opposition between individuals, groups, or entities. It can arise from various factors such as differences in opinions, goals, values, interests, or actions. Conflict often involves a deeper and more complex issue or problem, and it may persist over a longer duration. Conflict can occur on different levels, including interpersonal, societal, or international. It may involve verbal arguments, ideological disputes, power struggles, or even physical confrontations. Conflict can be constructive if it leads to positive change or resolution, but it can also be destructive if it escalates without a productive resolution.
>
> Clash: Clash, on the other hand, typically refers to a more immediate and direct confrontation or disagreement between two or more parties. It implies a sudden and forceful collision of opposing ideas, interests, or actions. A clash often occurs when two or more perspectives or approaches are incompatible or **contradictory**, leading to a clash of interests or values. Clashes can occur in various contexts, including personal relationships, business negotiations, or even clashes between opposing forces in a conflict or war. While a clash may be part of a larger conflict, it can also refer to a standalone incident that highlights a sharp divergence of views or interests.
>
> In summary, conflict is a broader and more encompassing term that describes a general state of disagreement or opposition, while clash refers to a more immediate and forceful confrontation between conflicting parties. A conflict can involve multiple clashes, and clashes can contribute to a larger conflict. Hint: 冲突  clash: 碰撞

```javascript
The words "recover," "restore," and "resume" all have slightly different meanings, although they are often used interchangeably in casual conversation. Here are the definitions and differences between these words:

Recover: To recover means to regain something that was lost or stolen. It can refer to both physical objects (such as a lost item) or abstract concepts (such as lost health or lost data). For example, if you recover from an illness, it means that you regain your health. If you recover lost data from a computer, it means that you are able to access the data again.
Restore: To restore means to bring something back to its original state or condition. This often involves repairing or fixing something that was damaged or degraded over time. For example, if you restore an old car, it means that you repair and refurbish it to bring it back to its original condition.
Resume: To resume means to begin again after a pause or interruption. It often refers to an activity or process that was stopped temporarily and then restarted. For example, if you resume a conversation with someone, it means that you pick up where you left off after a pause. If you resume work after a vacation, it means that you start working again after a break.

In summary, "recover" is about regaining something that was lost or stolen, "restore" is about bringing something back to its original state, and "resume" is about starting something again after a pause or interruption.

[adj] Higher loan-to-deposit ratios are better for funding efficiency, but lower figures are better for prudent control./a prudent decision/investment

"sensible and careful when you make judgements and decisions; avoiding unnecessary risks" "精明的"



Prudent and rigorous are two words that can be used to describe different approaches or attitudes towards something. Here are the main differences between the two:

- Prudent: This word typically refers to being careful and cautious in making decisions or taking actions. A person who is prudent is often described as being wise, sensible, or judicious. Prudence involves considering the potential risks and consequences of one's actions and making choices that are likely to result in a positive outcome. It is often associated with financial matters, where making prudent investments means being careful not to take unnecessary risks.
- Rigorous: This word generally means being thorough and precise in one's work or approach to a task. A person who is rigorous is often described as being exacting, meticulous, or rigorous. Rigor involves paying close attention to detail and making sure that every step of a process is carried out correctly. It is often associated with scientific research, where rigorous methods are used to ensure that the results are reliable and accurate.

So, while both words describe a careful approach, the main difference lies in the focus of attention. Prudence is concerned with **avoiding unnecessary risks and ensuring a positive outcome**, while rigor is **focused on achieving a precise and accurate result**.

"Dethroned," on the other hand, often implies a more peaceful or non-violent removal from power, typically through legal or political means. For example, a monarch might be dethroned through a parliamentary vote or by abdicating the throne voluntarily.

"Young" is a more general term that simply refers to someone who is not old or someone who is in the early stages of life. It can describe people of any age who are not considered to be middle-aged or elderly. For example, a teenager, a person in their 20s, or someone in their 40s who is still considered young might all be described as "young."

"Youthful," on the other hand, specifically implies qualities associated with youthfulness such as energy, vitality, and a youthful appearance. It describes someone who exhibits the qualities that are typically associated with young people, regardless of their actual age. For example, someone in their 50s who is physically fit and has a youthful appearance might be described as "youthful."

In summary, "young" simply describes someone who is not old, while "youthful" specifically describes someone who possesses the qualities that are associated with youthfulness, regardless of their actual age.

03.regarding vs regardless

"Regard" means "**talk about, think about, pay attention to**." So when you "regard" something, you are talking about it, or thinking about it. We often use the word "regarding" to re-introduce a topic in the conversation that was ALREADY talked about previously. For example, on Tuesday you ask your boss if you can have a vacation. On Wednesday, your boss says "**Regarding your vacation, I'm sorry, but you can't have one.**" You already talked about the vacation once before, and your boss is bringing up the topic again by using the word "regarding," which is like saying "please think about this topic again."  

"-less" at the end of a word means "without," so the word "regardless" means "without regard." So, "regardless" means it is something unimportant that you don't need to think about. If you beg your boss for a vacation, "Please! It's my sister's wedding that day!" Your boss might say "**Regardless, you still need to work" or "You still need to work regardless of your sister's wedding.**" This means that your boss thinks your sister's wedding is not important to the conversation, so you shouldn't talk talk about it or think about it.  

Extra: You'll often see people end their emails or letters with the word "Regards" or "Best regards." This is a polite and friendly way to say goodbye, which means "I am thinking about you, I hope you are ok." Also, you might hear people say "**Give my regards to your sister!**" which means "Let your sister know that I was thinking about her, and I hope she's doing well!
